DNS Tunneling Implemented as net.Conn in Go

Welcome to `dnsconn` â€“ an innovative experimental project that aims to implement DNS tunneling using Go's `net.Listener` and `net.Conn` interfaces. This project opens up new possibilities for repurposing DNS as a transport layer, allowing for seamless integration of DNS tunneling into existing codebases.
